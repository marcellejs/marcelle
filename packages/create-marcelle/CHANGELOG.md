### Minor Changes

- 6825bef: A new application generator and CLI were introduced to overcome limitations of the previous CLI.
  Instead of requiring the global install of `@marcellejs/cli`, application generation has been moved to a `create-marcelle` package that can be used with `npm init` or `yarn create`.
  The CLI for generating components and managing the backend in a project is now installed as a development dependency in new projects, and does not require arguments.
